# Murder Mystery

> A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a â€‹murderâ€‹ that occurred sometime on â€‹Jan.15, 2018â€‹ and that it took place in â€‹SQL Cityâ€‹. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.
